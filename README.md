## Usage
### Setup
For easier use I created two separate shell executables
1. Run first script so the image would be built. Run in terminal: ``./build.sh``
2. Then access containerâ€™s bash: ``/run.sh`` immediately you will be redirected to container environment
###Console command ``app:shipment``
####Simple usage
1. Run the command e.g: ``php bin/console app:shipment dhl``
2. Tests: ``bin/phpunit tests``

### Requirements
- We expect this to be Unit tested. It is not a requirement to have 100% coverage, but basic functionality should be tested.
- APIs should be mocked, returning hard-coded results.
- Even though exercise contains 3 providers only, design your code to be extensible and as flexible as possible. Implementing new providers should be very straightforward. If you want you can do only 2 shipping providers.
- Do not implement any persistence layer or ORM, entity should be constructed with mock data.

### Problem
Please implement a console command which would register a shipment for given shipping provider key. Provider key could be passed as an argument from STDIN. The rest order data could be mocked.

Each shipping provider could deliver the Order (`\App\Entity\Order`), however in the future we might add validation to limit supported providers. Provider is chosen by `\App\Entity\Order::getShippingProviderKey` method which returns provider key: __ups__, __omniva__ or __dhl__.
Shipment is registered by calling `\App\Service\Order::registerShipping` method, which should ensure a chosen provider is notified about the new shipment.

Command should exit if shipment has been registered successfully.

### Provider specifications
- **UPS**, send by api to `upsfake.com/register` -> `order_id`, `country`, `street`, `city`, `post_code`
- **OMNIVA** - get pick up point id by calling the api `omnivafake.com/pickup/find` : `country`, `post_code`, then send registration to `omnivafake.com/register` using `pickup_point_id` and `order_id`
- **DHL**, send by api to `dhlfake.com/register` -> `order_id`, `country`, `address`, `town`, `zip_code` 

### Evaluation Criteria
We will evaluate code based on these criteria:
- Code functions as specified in the Problem
- Whether tests pass (`php bin/phpunit ./tests`)
- Code readability and quality
- System flexibility and extensibility
